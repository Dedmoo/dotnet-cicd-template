# CI/CD Pipeline Blueprint

## A Project-Agnostic Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment Pattern on a Self-Hosted Runner

**Document language:** English (Turkish version: [`dotnet-cicd-template.tr.md`](./dotnet-cicd-template.tr.md))
**Goal:** A reusable CI/CD pattern adaptable to any .NET project in about 15 minutes.

## Abstract

This document presents a **project-agnostic** CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) pipeline pattern, along with accompanying copy-paste template files that are not tied to any specific application. The goal is to make a once-designed delivery discipline (automatic build/test, approval-gated production deployment, health checks and automatic rollback) portable to new projects at low cost. At the center of the design is a **single source of configuration** (`SERVICES`); by filling in only this block, a user can manage one or many services through the same pipeline. The pattern is built on technology-agnostic principles (build-once/deploy-many, approval gate, fail-safe rollback); the concrete templates target .NET/ASP.NET Core but can be adapted to other stacks by changing only three commands.

**Keywords:** CI/CD, DevOps, GitHub Actions, self-hosted runner, template, reusability, automatic rollback.

## 1. Design Philosophy

Most CI/CD documentation is tightly coupled to a specific application, which renders it useless for other projects. The core goal of this template is the opposite: **to reduce everything application-specific to a variable.** Ports, deployment directories, service names and health endpoints are treated not as "constants" but as "parameters." Thus, the pipeline's logic (when it builds, who approves, when it rolls back) stays unchanged, while "what" is deployed can vary from project to project.

This approach rests on three engineering principles:

- **Single source of truth:** Service definitions live only in the `SERVICES` block; they are not repeated anywhere.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Build/test logic is gathered into a composite action, and deploy/rollback logic into a single script.
- **Fail-safe default:** A faulty deployment is automatically rolled back; the default behavior protects the user.

## 2. Architecture Pattern

The pattern comprises three logical layers and remains the same regardless of which application is used:

```mermaid

    subgraph GH["GitHub (Cloud)"]
        direction TB
        REPO["Repository<br/>workflows + source code"]
        CI["CI · automatic (push / PR)"]
        CD["Deploy · manual"]
        RB["Rollback · manual"]
        ENV{{"production<br/>approval gate"}}
        REPO --> CI
        REPO --> CD
        REPO --> RB
        CD --> ENV
        RB --> ENV
    end

    subgraph HOST["Self-Hosted Runner Host (Linux)"]
        direction TB
        RUNNER(["Self-hosted GitHub Actions runner"])
        subgraph SVC["Services · systemd · defined by SERVICES"]
            direction LR
            S1["service #1<br/>/opt/… : port"]
            S2["service #2<br/>/opt/… : port"]
            SN["service #N …"]
        end
        BK["nginx · reverse proxy · graceful reload"]
        SOCK["Unix socket · /run/cicd/*.sock"]
        DB[("database / infra<br/>optional")]
        RUNNER --> SVC
        RUNNER --> BK
        RUNNER --> SOCK
        BK --> SVC
        SOCK --> SVC
        SVC --> DB
    end

    CI ==>|no approval| RUNNER
    ENV ==>|after approval| RUNNER
```

The number of services (one, two, or more) depends only on the number of lines added to the `SERVICES` block; the workflows iterate over these lines.

## 3. Single Source of Configuration: `SERVICES`

The entire system is configured with a simple text block in the following format. Each line represents one service:

```
name|csproj|deploy_dir|service_name|health_url
```

| Field | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | Short identifier of the service (artifact subfolder) | `web` |
| `csproj` | Project file to publish | `src/Web/Web.csproj` |
| `deploy_dir` | Target directory on the host | `/opt/myapp-web` |
| `service_name` | systemd service name | `myapp-web` |
| `health_url` | nginx public port + health path | `http://SERVER-IP:5001/health` |

This block is defined in one place as a **repo variable (`vars.SERVICES`)** on GitHub; `continuous-integration.yml`, `production-deploy.yml` and `production-rollback.yml` read this variable (no file editing needed). In host setup, the same value is passed once to `setup-host.sh` as an environment variable. CI uses only the first two fields (`name|csproj`); the rest are ignored.

**Derived values:** The `dll` name is derived from `csproj` (`Web.csproj` → `Web.dll`), and the nginx port and health path are extracted automatically from `health_url`. .NET services start with `--urls http://unix:<socket>` and do not expose a port directly to the outside; nginx connects via the Unix socket.

## 4. Pipeline Components

### 4.1 CI (`continuous-integration.yml` + `reusable-dotnet-build.yml` + `build-test` action)

- **Trigger:** Every `push` and every `pull_request` to `main`.
- **Does:** .NET version validation → NuGet cache → restore → build → test.
- **Artifact:** Only on push to `main`, each service is published under `PUBLISH_ROOT/<name>` and retained for 30 days as a **single combined artifact** (`app-publish`).
- **Why decoupled?** This tested output can later be deployed unchanged (*build-once, deploy-many*).
- **Permissions:** Workflows run with least privilege (`permissions: contents: read`); the token's scope is not left needlessly broad.

### 4.2 Deploy (`production-deploy.yml` + `pipeline.sh`) — Blue-Green

Manually triggered (`workflow_dispatch`), taking two inputs: `description` (mandatory) and `source`. The `source` default is **`ci_artifact`** (recommended): it uses the latest successful CI output and performs a **commit provenance check** — if the commit of the CI run that produced the artifact (`headSha`) does not match the deployed commit (`github.sha`), the deploy stops. `build_from_source` rebuilds from source at deploy time.

**Blue-green flow:** Each service has two directories (`deploy_dir-blue`, `deploy_dir-green`) and two systemd units (`service_name-blue`, `service_name-green`). nginx always routes to one color via a Unix socket (the active color). Deploy writes to the idle color; once health passes nginx does a graceful reload to switch to the new active color.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A["Manual trigger + production approval"] --> B["download CI artifact (+provenance) OR build+test"]
    B --> C["publish: to IDLE color (blue/green)"]
    C --> D["write-env + write-info: to IDLE color directory"]
    D --> E["restart: only the IDLE color systemd unit"]
    E --> F["health: curl --unix-socket on IDLE color Unix socket"]
    F --> G{"healthy?"}
    G -->|Yes| H["nginx switch: rewrite upstream + graceful reload"]
    H --> I["Success — old color stays up (instant rollback target)"]
    G -->|No| J["NO switch — live NOT affected — job fails"]
```

`pipeline.sh` subcommands: `publish-source`, `deploy-artifacts`, `write-env`, `write-info`, `restart`, `health`, `health-active`, `switch`, `rollback`. All read `SERVICES` and iterate over all services.

### 4.3 Rollback (`production-rollback.yml`) — Blue-Green

Two modes:
- `previous_folder`: The nginx upstream file is **rewritten to the other color** + graceful reload. No file copy, no build, zero downtime — the old color was already running.
- `specific_commit`: The given commit is built into the idle color + restart + health socket check; once it passes, nginx switches.

A health check runs at the end of both modes.

## 5. Universal Principles

| Principle | How it is applied | Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| Build-once, deploy-many | `ci_artifact` source (default) | Released comes from the same verified commit that was tested (commit-level provenance, not byte-for-byte) |
| Provenance | `ci_artifact` commit == deploy commit | The tested commit equals the released commit |
| Approval gate | `environment: production` + reviewer/self-review/`main` | Prevents unauthorized production deploys |
| Least privilege | `permissions: contents: read` (+ `actions: read` on deploy) | Narrows the token's scope |
| Auditability | `.deploy-info` + `run-name` | Who/when/why record |
| Zero-downtime (blue-green) | write to idle; nginx switch on health pass | Broken deploy never reaches live |
| Fail-safe | health fails → nginx NOT switched; live unchanged | Faulty deploy has zero user impact |
| Race-condition prevention | `concurrency` group | Concurrent deploys do not clash |

## 6. Adapting to Your Project (Step by Step)

To use this template you **edit no files.** All application-specific values are entered from the GitHub UI as **Variables** and **Secrets**; the workflows read them.

1. **Copy the template:** Copy `templates/.github` and `templates/scripts` to the root of your own repository.
2. **Add Variables:** GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables:
   - `SERVICES` (required): the service list, one line each `name|csproj|deploy_dir|service_name|health_url`.
   - `RUNNER_LABEL` (optional): runner label (default `self-hosted`).
   - `ARTIFACT_NAME` (optional): artifact name (default `app-publish`).
3. **Add Secrets (optional):** Put `KEY=VALUE` lines into the `APP_ENV` secret (connection strings, API keys). At deploy it is injected into each service as `.env`; .NET applies them over `appsettings` automatically.
4. **Create and harden the `production` environment:** Settings → Environments → add `production`; define **required reviewers**, enable **prevent self-review**, and restrict deployments to the **`main`** branch only (you may add an optional **wait timer**). These settings make the approval gate genuinely effective.
5. **Prepare the host:** Once on the runner machine (with the same `SERVICES` value as step 2):
   ```bash
   sudo SERVICES="web|src/Web/Web.csproj|/opt/myapp-web|myapp-web|http://127.0.0.1:5001" \
        bash scripts/setup-host.sh
   ```
   (For multiple services, `SERVICES` can be multi-line.)
6. **Run the first CI:** Push to `main`; confirm it is green.
7. **Perform the first deployment:** Actions → **Production Deploy** → enter a description, approve.

## 7. Different Technology Stacks

The pipeline's logic is technology-agnostic; only **three points** are specific to .NET and can be changed easily:

| Stage | .NET (default) | Node.js example | Java example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Build/test | `dotnet build/test` (`build-test` action) | `npm ci && npm test` | `mvn verify` |
| Publish | `dotnet publish` (`pipeline.sh`) | `npm run build` | `mvn package` |
| Run | `dotnet App.dll --urls ...` (`setup-host.sh`) | `node dist/server.js` | `java -jar app.jar` |

Updating these three commands is sufficient to move the pattern to a different stack; the approval, health-check, backup and rollback logic remains as is.

## 9. Evaluation and Limitations

**Strengths:** Single source of configuration, N-service support, low adaptation cost, fail-safe deployment, technology-agnostic logic.

**Limitations and recommendations:**

- **A single runner** is a single point of failure; multiple runners are recommended for critical environments.
- **Blue-green deployment** is integrated by default and provides connection-level zero-downtime. However, **in-process memory state** (cart, session, cache) is not shared between the two colors — different .NET processes cannot read the same memory address. Redis or a database must be used for persistent state. This constraint must be considered for applications with sticky sessions.
- **Database migrations** are not automatic in the template; enable via `scripts/ensure-infra.sh` and Variable `RUN_ENSURE_INFRA=true`. Order: **migrate → idle deploy → health → switch**. Migrations must be backward-compatible (schema updates while the active color still serves traffic).
- **Secrets** should be kept in GitHub Secrets / a secret vault rather than in configuration files.

## 10. Appendix: Concrete Example (eShopOnWeb)

A fully filled-in (placeholder-free) instance of this pattern is implemented on Microsoft eShopOnWeb. Running with two .NET services (Web storefront on 5001, PublicApi on 5200) and a SQL Server instance, this example can be used as a reference for how the template is filled in practice. In the example, `SERVICES` is filled as follows:

```
web|src/Web/Web.csproj|/opt/eshopweb|eshopweb|http://127.0.0.1:5001
api|src/PublicApi/PublicApi.csproj|/opt/eshopapi|eshopapi|http://127.0.0.1:5200
```

> Note: eShopOnWeb is only an example; you do not need it to use this template.
